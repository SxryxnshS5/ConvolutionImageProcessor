# Convolution Image Processor (WPF MVVM)

A simple WPF application to learn and demonstrate image convolution filters using the MVVM pattern in C#.

## About

This project applies basic convolution filters (blur, sharpen, edge detection, etc.) to images. Itâ€™s designed as a learning tool to understand how convolution works in image processing.

Convolution is a fundamental operation used to process images by applying kernels (small matrices) to detect features or enhance visuals. Itâ€™s widely used in photo editing, computer vision, and machine learning.

## Features

- Load and display images
- Choose from different convolution kernels
- Apply filters and view results instantly
- Save processed images
- Responsive UI with processing status indicator

## Technologies

- C#  
- WPF  
- MVVM pattern  
- Bitmap and BitmapImage conversions  

## Usage

1. Load an image using the **Load Image** button  
2. Select a convolution filter from the dropdown  
3. Click **Process** to apply the filter  
4. View the result image  
5. Save the processed image if you like  

## Why Convolution?

Convolution lets you apply transformations to images by sliding a kernel over pixels. Itâ€™s how effects like blurring, sharpening, and edge detection work under the hood. Understanding this is key for anyone interested in image processing or computer vision.
